# Technical Test

We have a problem with [an email](email-dark-mode.html) that does not correctly display a barre code in dark mode as the background color is black and scanners are expecting white color.

Please fix this issue by forcing a white background at least inside the Decathlon fictive card handling the barre code.

Tip: in order to force Chrome dark mode you can find it using `chrome://flags` URL in the browser.

You can add responsive comportment to this old fashioned email.
